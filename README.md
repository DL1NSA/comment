With ‚ù§Ô∏è by Pouda.

Comment 6 is a way to decorate your code with lines. What it does is it generates headings for parts of your code. I have always hard a really hard time to keep track of where a function starts and where it ends, and there are millions of ways to tackle the problem. But when I write in a notebook, I simply write headers, and draw lines, why couldn't we have it in our codes?

With Comment 6 you can simply create these headings:

And edit them whenever you want:

## Notes üí°

- __Indentation Matters__ &mdash; The way comment works is that you pick an empty line and indent as far as you wish your comment is going to be indented. You then start typing the comment and then use the menu or keybindings to generate the comment. The size and indentation of your resulting comment is determined by that indentation.

- __Only Use These Comments To Create Logical Parts In Your Codes__ &mdash; Try to separate, types, functions, classes, the parts of the classes. The More organized you are the better.

- __Adopt The Clarity Style To Your Codes__ &mdash; Try to have files that are minimal as possible. Have one class per file if you can. When a file move to more than a few hundred lines try to break it into different files. Try to write the best code you can. It always pays the efforts.
